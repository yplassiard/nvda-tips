# nvda-tips
TIPS is a NVDA add-on providing Tips for the NVDA screen reader, whenever you need them.
## Build
To build the addon you need the SCons package and a Python 2.7 distribution. Then, simply:
- scons -s

This will build a tips-x.y.nvda-addon which you can install into your NVDA like any other addon.

## Usage
This addon can be used in two ways:
- When you focus an element and wait for about 2 seconds, a tip is announced indicating its type and what you can do with that element.
- You can also press the NVDA+h shortcut (which is editable into the NvDA gesture and command dialog), to listen to a more context help.

## Issue / Contact
Feel free to report any issue or suggestion either via GitHub issues.
